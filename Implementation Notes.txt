- Assume that System.Random is "random enough"!
- Assume won't get same random number twice
- Create a seam to inject a non-random random generator for testing purposes
- Don't impose requirement to make sure the loot table weightings add up to any value( easier to use)
- Go with simple naive logger implementation for now as arbitrary dependency
- Use simple OWIN project to host endpoint


Tests:

- Using 2 different "flavours", SpecFlow and TickSpec, 'cos we talked about it on the phone
- Note that the SpecFlow package is single-handedly half of the file size of the entire thing!!!
- Am using latest from master of TickSpec, which isn't currently a public nuget package, so it came from a local build and import
- Added simple scenarios to cover main requirements; there would probably be more, especially as the loot table started to come from a different source
